TODO
implement env.h and env.c 

semant.h: 
void SEM_transProg(A_exp exp);

implement semant.c 
        The four recursive functions
        void  SEM_trnasProg(A_exp exp);

that type checks exp.
        Handle recursive and mutually recursive declarations.
        Check that a "break" is within a "for" or "while"
        Illegal cycles in type declaration  

implement a main() (in parse.c) that: 
        calls the parser
        calls the function SEM_transProg()
